## Terminology
ValueSets definition files are found in fsh/terminology with the exception of the extension of PlanDefinition.status which is defined with the extension.

See the [FSH spec](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#defining-value-sets) for details about how to change these.
