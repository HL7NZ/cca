### Plan status

The status of the overall plan is exposed in the PlanDefinition.status element, supported by an extension. The statuses that are used are:

<table>
    <tr><th>Business status</th><th>Meaning</th><th>PlanDefinition.status</th><th>Extension</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Published</td><td>The regimen is available for use</td><td>active</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Provisionally published</td>
        <td>The regimen is available for use, but is still undergoing a review so may change</td>
        <td>active</td><td><a href="StructureDefinition-regimen-under-review.html">regimen-under-review</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Discontinued</td><td>The regimen is no longer in use</td><td>retired</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Superceeded</td><td>The regimen is no longer in use, but has been superceeded by another</td><td>retired</td>
    <td><a href="StructureDefinition-replaced-by.html">replaced-by</a></td></tr>

</table>

### UseContext

The PlanDefinition.useContext element is used for 2 main items.

The cancers for which the regimen is intended to treat. There can be up to 3 of these, representing the cancer type, sub-type and sub-sub-type in that order. The 'code' value for these is 'focus' - indicating that these are the focus of the regimen.

### Support factors

Support factors are represented by an [extension]() which has 2 child elements - the factor itself, and the value of the factor. Both elements are coded and bound to a valueset, but the value valueset contins all possible values for all support factors - ie there is not one for each specific type.
